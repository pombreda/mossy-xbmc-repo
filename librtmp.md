## What it is ##

**librtmp** is software used by XBMC for viewing videos on many websites.

## The problems ##

  * Some websites require a newer version of **librtmp** than the stock version installed with XBMC. This seems to be particularly true of the version installed with certain platforms, e.g. **Android**.
  * Using the **Proxy for HTTP and streams** method requires a newer version of **librtmp** than the stock version installed with XBMC, on all platforms.

## How to update librtmp ##

If there is no pre-compiled version available for your platform you will need to compile librtmp from source code and replace the version installed by XBMC. See [HOW-TO:Update librtmp](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Update_librtmp). For Android users see [Rtmpdump build for Android](http://stream-recorder.com/forum/rtmpdump-build-android-t13466.html). See also the [librtmp Help Thread](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=162307) which has binaries for different platforms including Android.

_Update for Android users_: Try the Gotham version of XBMC before experimenting with changing librtmp, seems to work for some users.
